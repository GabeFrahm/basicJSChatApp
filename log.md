Day 1 of working on this project. I've never written a project in JS before, but I suppose now's a better time to learn than ever.
This project was inspired by the shortcomings of Zoom, especially on the security front. Seriously, what kind of application fakes a MacOS system prompt to make the installer "easier." That's just the begining of it though. Anyway, I don't plan on making a fully fledged replacement for Zoom, but I want to at least make a simple chat app in the browser.
## Progress Made Today:
* Installed NodeJS. Gotta start somewhere right?
* Installed two libraries essential to getting this show on the road (express.js and )
